# Notes
I use pywal to change terminal colors and made a custom script to change cava colors too.

I use a polybar theme by [Adi](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes), modified it to have the bar floating and have a custom script to have mpd song name to scroll.

I have modes which does special shortcuts, depending on the mode, u can find details about it in the scripts/function/idea.( I still haven't completed all the features yet)
