# Notes
* Polybar theme by [Adi](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes), modified it to have the bar floating and have a custom script to have mpd song name to scroll.
* [Rog-control-center](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl/-/tree/main/rog-control-center) to control the keyboard lighting
* [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) to power limit the cpu on battery, and automatically increase the fan speed when under load.
* Although the fan speed wouldn't reach the max rpm, so I manually have to change the fan speed in the [rog-control-center](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl/-/tree/main/rog-control-center)
